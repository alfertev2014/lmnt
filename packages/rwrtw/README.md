# RWRTW

RWRTW is a tiny UI library for applications in web-browser. It has zero dependencies and strives to be close to native browser's API. It contains thin DOM helpers and minimal building blocks to structure and manage UI components, its view state and lifecycle.

See [Documentation](https://github.com/alfertev2014/rwrtw/blob/main/docs/README.md).
